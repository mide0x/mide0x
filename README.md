## 📌 Featured Projects
### 👁️ Percepta (In Progress)  
A vision-based browser automation framework where AI agents interact with the web visually — like a human — instead of parsing DOM code.  
- **Architecture**: "Eyes" (Playwright screenshots → VLM), "Hands" (PyAutoGUI + OpenCV), "Brain" (action loop).  
- **MVP Goal**: Automate multi-step tasks such as logging into GitHub entirely through perception + action.  
- **Future Direction**: YOLO for detection + VLMs for reasoning.  

### 🍴 CleanBites WebApp  
A restaurant discovery platform integrating UK hygiene ratings with Google Places API.  
- Served **20K+ restaurant entries** with optimized full-text search.  
- Built with **TypeScript, React, Django, Postgres, Docker**.  
👉 [Live Demo](https://cleanbites.uk)  

### ♿ Automated Web Accessibility  
AI-powered automation tool that fixes accessibility violations in real time.  
- Achieved **~85% rectification rate** across 200 webpages.  
- Built with **Node.js + Puppeteer**.
